## Key Highlights

### AWS CodeCommit
- Git-based source control service designed for secure, scalable code hosting
- Works well with GitFlow or Trunk-Based branching strategies
- Useful for team collaboration, review processes, and CI/CD automation

### AWS CodeBuild
- Fully managed build engine for compiling, testing, and packaging applications
- Customizable buildspec.yml to define build stages and environment steps
- Enables continuous integration with automatic test execution

### AWS CodeDeploy
- Deployment automation for EC2, Lambda functions, and on-premise systems
- Supports Blue/Green, Rolling Update, and Canary deployment patterns
- Helps minimize downtime while ensuring reliable releases

### AWS CodePipeline
- CI/CD pipeline service that orchestrates build → test → deploy steps
- Tracks version changes and automates multi-environment workflows
- Ideal for continuous delivery setups with minimal manual operations

### AWS CloudFormation
- Allows provisioning AWS infrastructure using declarative templates
- Supports stack updates, rollback protection, and drift detection
- Ensures consistent, repeatable infrastructure deployments

### AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)
- Write IaC using languages like TypeScript, Python, or JavaScript
- Uses high-level constructs to simplify infrastructure creation
- Compiles down to CloudFormation templates for production-ready deployment

### Container Services on AWS
- Discussed Docker containerization concepts for distributed workloads
- Amazon ECR: container registry with vulnerability scans and retention rules
- ECS & EKS: orchestration engines for scalable deployments
- AWS App Runner: simplest way to deploy container workloads without ops overhead

### Monitoring & Observability
- Amazon CloudWatch used for metrics collection, alarms, dashboards, log analysis
- AWS X-Ray for tracing requests and identifying performance bottlenecks
- Helps maintain application reliability and quick issue resolution

### DevOps Best Practices & Case Studies
- Introduced deployment models like feature toggles, canary rollout, A/B testing
- Encouraged automated testing inside CI/CD pipelines
- Covered real incident response workflows and lessons learned after failures
- Shared transformation journeys from startup to enterprise environments
