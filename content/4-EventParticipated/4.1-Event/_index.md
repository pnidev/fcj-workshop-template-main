# Summary Report: AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar (AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3)

## Event Objective
- Gaining deeper understanding of AWS Identity services including IAM, IAM Identity Center (SSO), and permission management workflows.
- Learning logging, monitoring, and threat-detection tools such as CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, and automation with EventBridge.
- Strengthening knowledge on Infrastructure Protection: VPC segmentation, secure network design, and public vs private resource placement.
- Studying cloud Data Protection principles and incident response best practices.

### Speakers
- **Mendel Grabski (Long)**: Former Head of Security & DevOps, Cloud Security Solution Architect  
- **Tinh Truong**: AWS Community Builder, Platform Engineer at TymerX  

## Key Highlights

### Identity & Access Management
- Reviewed core IAM foundations: users, roles, and policies, emphasizing the removal of long-term access keys.
- Explored IAM Identity Center for unified access and permission control across accounts.
- Highlighted security essentials such as MFA enforcement, regular credential rotation, and identity validation using IAM Access Analyzer.

### Detection
- Learned how CloudTrail captures and audits all API activity within AWS environments.
- Explored threat-analysis tools including GuardDuty and Security Hub for consolidated security visibility.
- Understood multi-layer logging: VPC Flow Logs, ALB access logs, and S3 server-access logs.
- Designed alerting and automated response patterns using EventBridge workflows.

### Infrastructure Protection
- Covered AWS KMS fundamentals: key policies, grants, and rotation options.
- Reviewed encryption strategies for data at rest and in transit across key AWS services (S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB).
- Investigated secure secret-handling methods with Secrets Manager and Parameter Store, including rotation patterns.
- Emphasized data-classification principles and building guardrails for controlled access.

### Incident Response
- Discussed the AWS incident-response lifecycle and common remediation workflows.
- Examined scenarios: compromised IAM credentials, unintended S3 public access, EC2 malware detection.
- Practiced evidence-collection steps such as snapshots, workload isolation, and log retrieval.
- Learned how automation using Lambda and Step Functions can accelerate incident containment and recovery.

## Event Experience
- Joining the **AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar** workshop helped deepen my understanding of cloud security and gave me opportunities to meet students from various universities as well as professionals working with AWS.  
- The hands-on insights into incident response and secure architecture broadened my perspective and enhanced my confidence when dealing with cloud-security challenges.  
- I also had the chance to interact with international experts sharing practical experiences, motivating me to participate more in CloudClub activities for continuous learning and memorable experiences.
