### Database & Storage Summary

In the game project, we use **AWS DynamoDB** and **AWS S3** to store player data, progress, scores, and avatars.

---

## DynamoDB – Main Database

DynamoDB is used to store:

- Player profile information  
- Player progress  
- Player scores across different game areas  

### Created Tables

1. UserProfiles
   - Partition Key (PK): `userId`

2. UserProgress
   - Partition Key (PK): `userId`

3. Scores
   - Partition Key (PK): `gameArea`
   - Sort Key (SK): `score`

### DynamoDB Streams

- Enabled with **Stream type: NEW IMAGE**
- DevOps provides the **Stream ARN** to the backend so Lambda can consume events.

---

## S3 – Store Player Avatars

### S3 Bucket Setup

- Bucket name: `game-avatars`
- Enabled **CORS**:
  - Allowed methods: `PUT`, `POST`, `GET`
  - Allowed origin: `*`

### Note

- Uploads should only be performed using **presigned URLs** generated by the backend.

### Summary

You have created:

- **3 DynamoDB tables**  
- **1 S3 bucket** for storing player avatars  

These resources will be used by the backend to securely manage and store player-related data.
