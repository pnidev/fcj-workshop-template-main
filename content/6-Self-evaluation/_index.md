During my internship at **FCJ AWS** from **September 8, 2025** to **December 9, 2025**, I had the opportunity to work directly in a real-world professional environment where I could apply academic knowledge while learning new workflows used in the organization.

My main responsibility was **developing a 2D endless runner game integrated with AWS services**, which helped me improve significantly in **programming, tool usage, teamwork, and task reporting**.  
Besides technical skills, I developed soft skills such as time management, communication, problem-solving and the ability to collaborate with teammates to complete sprint goals. I was proactive in researching, asking questions when needed, and following internal work processes.

To objectively reflect on the entire internship journey, I evaluated myself based on the following criteria:
