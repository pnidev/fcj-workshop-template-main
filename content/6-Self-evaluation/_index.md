During my internship at **FCJ AWS** from **September 8, 2025** to **December 9, 2025**, I had the opportunity to work directly in a real-world professional environment, applying academic knowledge while learning new workflows used within the organization.  
My primary responsibility was **developing a 2D endless runner game integrated with AWS services**, which significantly improved my **programming skills, tool usage, teamwork, and progress reporting**.

Beyond technical work, I gained experience in work organization, time management, communication with mentors, and collaboration with team members to achieve sprint goals. I consistently approached tasks proactively, researched documentation, asked questions when needed, and complied with internal guidelines.

Below is my self-evaluation throughout the internship period:
