### Week 11 Objectives:

* Gain an in-depth understanding of **High Availability (HA)** in cloud architecture.
* Design and operate a **multi-tier web application architecture**.
* Learn and compare different **Elastic Load Balancer types** (ALB, NLB, CLB) and their use cases.
* Implement **backup, replication, and disaster recovery (DR)** strategies for production workloads.

### Week 11 Outcomes:

* Solid understanding of **High Availability & Fault Tolerance** in practice.
* Successfully configured and tested multiple **Elastic Load Balancer types**.
* Completed a scalable **3-tier architecture** with multi-AZ redundancy.
* Designed a working **Disaster Recovery plan** with safe backup strategies.
* Built an application capable of operating reliably even under failure scenarios.

### Summary:

By the end of the week, I was able to:

* Design HA-based infrastructure aligned with AWS best practices.
* Operate Application Load Balancer for smart traffic routing.
* Build multi-tier and multi-AZ architectures that scale automatically.
* Configure automated backups and implement DR mechanisms.
* Perform live failover simulations to ensure production readiness.
