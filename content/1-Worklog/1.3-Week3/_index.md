### Week 3 Outcomes:

* Gained a strong foundation in **EC2 architecture, AMI usage, and instance types**.
* Successfully launched and accessed EC2 through SSH like a real remote server.
* Implemented **IAM Role permissions for S3** without using static access keys.
* Became familiar with **Cloud9** for code execution and basic deployments.
* Practiced full EC2 lifecycle management — run, configure, stop, terminate for cost optimization.

---

### Summary:

By the end of Week 3, I was able to:

* Deploy EC2 instances securely inside a VPC using Security Groups.
* Assign IAM Roles to instances for safe AWS resource access.
* Connect to EC2 servers and manage applications directly via SSH.
* Use Cloud9 as a cloud-native IDE for development and testing.
* Understand EC2 costing and avoid charges by proper resource shutdown.
