### Week 2 Outcomes:

* Developed a solid understanding of **Amazon VPC and its networking components**.
* Successfully configured Subnets, Route Tables, and Internet Gateway for connectivity.
* Clearly distinguished **Security Groups (stateful)** vs **NACLs (stateless)** and when to use each.
* Completed the hands-on lab involving VPC networking and connectivity setup.
* Installed and used AWS CLI for provisioning and deleting resources efficiently.

### Summary:

By the end of Week 2, I accomplished:

* Built a custom VPC with both private and public subnets.
* Configured routing for public internet access and set up NAT for private subnets.
* Applied layered security using both SG and NACL.
* Managed AWS resources via CLI with improved speed and repeatability.
* Built a strong foundation for upcoming modules on EC2, Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling.
