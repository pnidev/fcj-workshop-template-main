**This section** presents my complete 12-week AWS learning worklog.  
The roadmap was built progressively — starting with account setup and ending with designing production-ready cloud architectures with high resilience.

**Learning methodology**  
I began the program on September 9, 2025, maintaining a consistent schedule of 5 study sessions per week.  
Each day, I spent around 2–3 hours practicing directly within AWS Console, reading official documentation, and completing labs from the First Cloud Journey (FCJ) curriculum.

**Program Duration:** 12 consecutive weeks — equivalent to one quarter of practical training.

**Study breakdown:**
- 60% hands-on practice with AWS (deployment, configuration, debugging)
- 30% documentation review & architectural study
- 10% summarization, note-building & mini-challenge execution
